== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why using `kontur ädmin STYLE`? =

We used it for a while on all the pages we were seting up, programming themes. It is just a little approach to have a friendlier backend and quickly set the customer logo into the admin bar, change it to their colors and have a  a branded login-page set. 

= Where do I find the settings? =

Under WordPress Admin > Appearance > kontur admin STYLE  or click the link 'Settings' under the plugin in your WordPress Admin Plugins section.

= How to use my custom login page? =

You will have to enable the 'Use themed login page' option. You can change the backround of the login page, set your own logo and change the link to your custom link.
Under WordPress Admin > Appearance > kontur admin STYLE  or click the link 'Settings' under the plugin in your WordPress Admin Plugins section.

= My Icon, Logo, Photo in the wp admin bar?  =

You can set your icon, logo or photo to appear in the wp admin bar in the left hand corner in exchange to standard WorPress icon. Yours will be shown in the backend, and the editor pages as well as on the frontend
Under WordPress Admin > Appearance > kontur admin STYLE  or click the link 'Settings' under the plugin in your WordPress Admin Plugins section.

= Can I change the colors to fit my corporate design?  =

Yep. You can set your own colors, just as you like them. But be aware, that our plugin is supposed to work with the 'default' admin theme. We never tested it with any other, because we never heard of anyone using another setting. If you need / want 'kontur ädmin STYLE' to work, please let us know, and we will implement it into a future version. 

= Will there be more options in the future?  =

Yes. We are working on implementing and alternative icon - set to replace the standard 'dashicons' as well as renaming menu items - e.g. posts, media, pages... and inluding your own CSS to the admin plus setting your own dashboard. But please keep in mind, that this is a free plugin, meaning we do have to find the time to test and develop.

= Do you offer any other plugins for my Wordpress backend? =

Yes, two of them could do the job:

* [kontur font-o-mat](https://wordpress.org/plugins/kontur-font-o-mat/) for going wild with fonts on the Gutenberg editor
* [No All in one SEO Premium Nags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/no-aioseop-nags/) to stop the premium version spam AND to add your own CSS to the WP backend. 


= I need something else. Can I hire you? =

Yes. Please get in touch via email [email](hello@kontur.us) with a brief description of your requirements and budget for the project and we will start something else together.

= This plugin is simple, but I want to show my appreciation? =
